## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tjsasakifln/ledger-automator.git
cd ledger-automator

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the Model

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

**Note:** Model will be trained on only 43 samples - sufficient for demonstration but inadequate for real-world accuracy.

### 3. Classify Transactions

```bash
python scripts/classify.py
```

### 4. Launch Web Interface

```bash
streamlit run scripts/app.py
```

Access the demo at `http://localhost:8501`

## 📊 Sample Data Format

### Training Data (`training_data.csv`)
```csv
